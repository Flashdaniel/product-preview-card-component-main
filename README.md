how to make Responsive media using the picture tag.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<picture>
  <source media="(min-width: 40em)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" />
  <img
    class="product-img"
    src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum placed in an elegant, nice, confort position"
    width="100%"
  />

```
